## Projects

### *Target Corporation*

#### Anomaly Detection System for Data Pipeline
- Developed an anomaly detection system to prevent corrupt images from entering the data pipeline.
- Identified and blocked 30% of anomalous images, resulting in substantial reductions in processing time 
- Improved downstream algorithms, leading to an 8% enhancement in business metric.

#### Invoice Digitisation System
- Implemented OCR model fine-tuning to detect and recognise specific style of text used in invoices.
- Finetuned transformer based layout analysis model to locate table areas for text extraction.
- Finetuned table transformer architecture and identified and reconstructed tabular structures.
- Digitized table data into structured JSON format, preserving row and column information as keys.
- Extracted key attributes from invoices for image indexing and efficient searching.

#### Privacy Blur Feature Implementation 
- Developed a privacy blur feature for archived video streams.
  - Employed lightweight linear object tracking(kalman Filter) and yolo object detectors to reduce compute needs.
- Mentored junior team members, fostering their growth and enhancing the overall team's performance.

### *Embibe* 

#### Question Tagging and Topic Extraction System 
- Collaborated with SME, Data engineers and annotator team to gather and curate high-quality datasets for training and validation purposes.
